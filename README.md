# CNN Image Classifier

This project is a beginner-friendly image classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python. It is part of Faris's AI Engineering learning journey and follows the LinkedIn Learning course: *Deep Learning with Python: Convolutional Neural Networks* by Frederick Nwanganga.

## ðŸ“š Course Reference
- [Deep Learningwith Python: CNNs

## ðŸ§  Project Goals
- Understand and implement CNNs using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train a model on image datasets (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10)
- Evaluate model performance and visualize predictions
- Save and document the model for portfolio use

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in `notebooks/` to train and evaluate the model
4. Saved models will appear in `models/` and documentation in `docs/`
